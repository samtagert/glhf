## Built With
GLHF was written using Ruby On Rails, HTML, CSS, and a hint of JavaScript. The planning was done using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4JgmANng/wdi-project-2).

## Next Steps
My plans for this website primarily include more sorting options for the games and reviews. Sorting by release date, rating, favorites, and a combined search field allowing you to choose multiple sorting options and returning just the games that include all of the options you choose.
